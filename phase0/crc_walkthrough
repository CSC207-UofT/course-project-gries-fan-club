The user will enter the console, and be greeted by the homescreen. They can search through recipes that were imported
by the Loader and then the RecipeStorage creates the Recipe objects.
Now in the recipe search section, the user can type in a tag for the food, such as ‘gluten-free’. This will then use
the find method in the Recipe storage. For each tag that was specified by the user, the method calls the TagMatcher
class’ method, matches, where the method will return boolean values for whether or not certain recipes have the given
tag. Every RecipeImpl in the RecipeStorage will be iterated through, and then a list of the RecipeImpl where each
object contains all the tags will then be returned and can be viewed by the user.
