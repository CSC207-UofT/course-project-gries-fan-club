# JChef Accessibility Report

1. Equitable Use

   Our project currently requires that the user is capable of using a phone or tablet.
   We could allow for a wider range of people to use the app by providing new user interfaces that connect our app to different types of devices.
   This is achievable by attaching a new front-end to our code's backend.
   As well, all features are available to all users, there is no paywalls or ability checks.

2. Flexibility in Use

   Our program does not impose any restrictions on the users pace.
   Otherwise, we currently do not have modes such as a left-handed or dark mode.
   We could change these by implementing different modes in our GUI and this would not affect any of the internal logic.

3. Simple and Intuitive Use

   Our interface is simple and does not require the user to have technical knowledge of the program.
   Within our responses we include error codes and status messages which inform the user about where they should go and what might have gone wrong.
   As well, since our information is displayed in simple forms, information is not lost within masses of text.
   Anything that needs to be seen by the user is separated and made clear.

4. Perceptible Information

   Most of our information is currently displayed only as text.
   We intended to implement pictures to be displayed our ingredients and recipes but ran into time constraints.
   The information we display is quite concise and our GUI layout is also simple.
   So, while our information is only displayed in one manner, it is at least done in a digestible way.

5. Tolerance for Error

   While error handling within our backend is fairly strong, there is currently less on the front end.
   Some inputs require exact searches which may error if misspelled.
   If given more time, we would be able to implement better front-end error handling as well as softening the requirements of the backend, both of which would make our program more tolerant to errors.
   Lastly, there is little critical actions that the user can perform, at least nothing that couldn't be easily reverted (nothing like permanent transactions or data deletion).

7. Low Physical Effort

   Our app is currently implemented through an Android GUI.
   This requires low physical effort and does not impose any posture or position onto the user as they can utilise their device however is comfortable.
   Further, our app does not require any timed, repetitive, or intensive actions.

8. Size and Space for Approach and Use

   Since our project is currently within a phone, there is no real requirement for the space in which you use JChef.
   As long as the user has an area in which they can use their device, they can use JChef.
   No other restrictions are imposed as this is a software project; not hardware.

Our program is marketable to a wide audience, that is, anyone who wants to cook!
As described above, there are few restrictions imposed on who can currently use the app and if the demand for implementations of our app to accommodate a certain need was large enough, a new front-end could be made easily and without affecting the business logic.
For instance, the app could be ported to utilise screen readers if the demand was there.
In a commercial version of our app, we would require features such as user profiles and many online services.
Because of this the app would likely need a premium version which would limit our audience to those willing to pay for the service.

The main idea of our app is to connect users to recipes.
This can be applied to almost anyone and everyone.
As long as the user interface is applicable to an individuals needs, the information we wish to give back can be condensed to a string describing a recipe which keeps the options for use open.
Everyone needs to cook and eat so everyone needs our app.
